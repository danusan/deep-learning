        "Für mich war Google Colab neu. Mit Notebook hatte ich schon in den vorherigen Übungen zu Data Analytics gearbeitet, sonst brauchte ich es auch nicht gross. Ich habe auch zum ersten Mal mit dem fastAI Repository gearbeitet. Am Anfang war es schwierig zu verstehen, wie das alles zusammen funktioniert, aber mit dem Video-Tutorial konnte ich diese Probleme lösen. Die Integration von Colab mit fastAI war ebenfalls neu für mich, aber auch hier gab es keine größeren Schwierigkeiten.\n"
