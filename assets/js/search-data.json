Mit Notebook hatte ich schon in den vorherigen Übungen zu Data Analytics gearbeitet, sonst brauchte ich es auch nicht gross. Ich habe auch zum ersten Mal mit dem fastAI Repository gearbeitet. Am Anfang war es schwierig zu verstehen, wie das alles zusammen funktioniert, aber mit dem Video-Tutorial konnte ich diese Probleme lösen. Die Integration von Colab mit fastAI war ebenfalls neu für mich, aber auch hier gab es keine größeren Schwierigkeiten. . &#8220;Deep Learning for Coders&#8221; (Fragen 1-9) . Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not? random sampling is a perfectly fine way to create a validation set. The training set and test set come from roughly the same distribution so your randomly sampled validation set is a good proxy for the test set. Typically when your model improves on your validation set, you&#39;ll also see improvements on your test set. | What is overfitting? Provide an example. (With training set and validation set measure accuracy) If you train for too long, with not enough data, you will see the accuracy of you model start to get worse; this is called overfitting Example: If our model does much better on the training set than on the test set, then we&#39;re likely overfitting. For example, it would be a big red flag if our model saw 99% accuracy on the training set but only 55% accuracy on the test set. | What is a metric? How does it differ from &quot;loss&quot;? A metric is used to judge the performance of your model. This is only for you to look at and has nothing to do with the optimization process. (What I care about=&gt; error rate) | The loss function is used to optimize your model. This is the function that will get minimized by the optimizer. (computer is using it=&gt;measure of performance) . How can pretrained models help? (You don’t have to work from scratch)- Models that are pre-trained on ImageNet are good at detecting high-level features like edges, patterns, etc. These models understand certain feature representations, which can be reused. | What is the &quot;head&quot; of a model? Head is the top of a network. For instance, on the bottom (where data comes in) you take convolution layers of some model, say resnet. | What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers? Find forms, text etc | Are image models only useful for photos? No you can use it also for others | No you can use it for other thins tooWhat is an &quot;architecture&quot;? mathematical function, that you optimize, tells about how many layers are OR The template of the model that we’re trying to fit; the actual mathematical function that we’re passing the input data and parameters to | What is segmentation? Customer segmentation: How machine learning makes marketing smart. ... This is possible through segmentation, the process of dividing customers into different groups based on their behavior or characteristics. | Can we always use a random sample for a validation set?

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
